<div id="khistory">
While a graduate student &amp; resident in hospital pharmacy&nbsp; during the late 1960's, the inventor researched a number of possible agents for topical treatment of severe 
                    human burn wounds.&nbsp; This work was conducted through the auspices of the surgery department in the burn treatment center of a large university teaching hospital.&nbsp; A number of compounds were studied.&nbsp; Serendipity 
                    played a role in discovery.&nbsp; One compound stood out among the rest. This product was studied extensively and produced a sizable piece of research and a graduate thesis.<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<b> Product Content</b> 

<br><br>

As a spin-off from the above mentioned&nbsp; research work,&nbsp; a&nbsp; search of 
                    compatible&nbsp; NATURAL compounds&nbsp; showed great promise.&nbsp; A combination of a group of naturally derived botanical agents&nbsp; indicated a very beneficial effect on&nbsp; healthy but dry chapped skin.&nbsp; These 
                    included the&nbsp; "rapid-healing" effects of the active ingredient in&nbsp; comfrey.(Symphytum). This agent, of plant origin , formerly was considered a "barnyard" weed.&nbsp; Another&nbsp; naturally 
                    derived active component&nbsp; is Vitamin E which acts&nbsp; as an active anti-oxidant.&nbsp; Finally a Phospholipid is included in the formulation&nbsp; and acts as a re-hydrating &amp; re-moisturizing agent. Both the 
                    Vitamin E and the Phospholipid are derived from the&nbsp; common soybean.&nbsp; The above agents are incorporated in a non-greasy hydrophilic base.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 


                    <b>Commercial&nbsp;Product Development&nbsp;</b> 


<br><br>

Many years later, the inventor owned and operated a community retail pharmacy.&nbsp; Often times, customers would lament the lack of 
                    effective skincare products&nbsp; &amp; that were reasonably priced.&nbsp; Usual complaints were related to problems with dry skin, cracking cuticles and red chapped hands.&nbsp; The research of earlier years was recalled and a 
                    re-hydrating and healing skincare product was offered to the public.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<b> Suggested Use</b> <br><br>


Normally, we  suggest that&nbsp; "Kermit's Wonderful® Skincare may be applied to any external area of the body when skin is dry, chapped or cracked from water or weather exposure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our experience indicates that the product 
                    must go on at bedtime to allow for overnight healing benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, you may apply Kermit's Wonderful® at anytime of day and as often as you wish.&nbsp; However, it is not necessary to apply a heavy layer of 
                    product. This is very concentrated. Only small amounts are required.&nbsp; For example, it is our feeling that a 1 oz. Jar of Kermit's Wonderful® will last up to a month with daily use. A 4 oz. Jar will last up to 3 months. So, 
                    you can see it is still low-cost yet effective.<br><br>Finally, let us be clear!&nbsp; "Kermit's Wonderful® is not a magic potion.&nbsp; It is a kindly dermatologic product that is just plain friendly to the skin.
